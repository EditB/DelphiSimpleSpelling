# Delphi Simple Spelling

This project is to practice Delphi (Firemonkey). It is a simple spelling corrector (based on Delphi Basics by Neil Moffatt).
Since the original project was for VCL and I did FireMonkey I had to modify things to make them work, so it's not exactly the same as the tutorial.
Also note that I do prefer colours so I changed the design a bit as well (using color buttons etc).

Delphi is real good fun! Have a go at it! :-)
